Rubik's Cube Solver: This program solves a Rubik's cube

  - It first creates a Rubik's cube by joining 6 3x3 lists to make the faces of the cube
  - It then randomly scrambles the cube
  - And finally solves the cube using Beginner's method

To be Implemented/Ideas:

  - Prime turns (-90 degree turns)
  - Advanced algorithms
  
  - Image processing
    - Take two pictures of the cube making sure to get all 6 faces. (3 in one picture and 3 in the other)
    - Recreate the cube and print move solution to solve cube
  - Real-Life Solver
    - Using raspberry pi, motors, and cameras we can create something to solve a Rubik's cube in real life.
      - We would need special parts for connecting motor with cube.
      - 3D printer would be needed

Code needs to be cleaned up and organized.

Bugs:
  - When creating the initial cross program might crash. Need to update intuitive way to create cross that is less error prone
